She is an Assistant Professor in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University and leads the SFU Rosie Lab, where she builds artificial intelligence software for robots to interact with social intelligence and empathy. Her research addresses the question 'Could a robot have feelings?' by combining neuroscience, machine learning and developmental psychology. Angelica has a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from Kyoto University, Japan, specializing in AI applied to Robotics, and a B.Sc. in Computing Science (specializing in Artificial Intelligence) from Simon Fraser University in Canada. Before founding the Rosie Lab, Angelica worked on software teams at SoftBank and Aldebaran Robotics, where she assisted in the development of the infamous Pepper robot. She also previously worked as an intern software engineer and researcher at Google, Honda Research Institute Japan, and I3S-CNRS, France. She also served as a journalist for the IEEE Spectrum Automaton Robotics Blog. Passionate about diversity, she is also Director of the Invent the Future (AI4ALL) program for Canada. She has also developed the SFU Computer Science Teaching Toolkit, with the goal of inspiring people of all backgrounds to pursue Computing Science."
