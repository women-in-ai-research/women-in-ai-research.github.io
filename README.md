## Welcome to Women in AI Research (WiAIR) 👋

Women in AI Research (WiAIR) is a podcast dedicated to celebrating the remarkable contributions of female AI researchers from around the globe. Our mission is to challenge the prevailing perception that AI research is predominantly male-driven. 

## 🎙️ About WiAIR

In WiAIR, we interview successful female AI researchers coming from diverse cultural backgrounds, showcasing their inspirational cutting-edge research and insights into the future of AI. Through these conversations, we explore their personal journeys - how they overcome unique challenges, balance careers and family life, and make difficult decisions when necessary. We aim to understand how women in AI research perceive success and what it takes to achieve their goals. 

With the WiAIR podcast, our goal is to empower early career researchers, especially women, to pursue their passion for AI and make an impact in this exciting rapidly growing field. You will learn from women at different career stages, stay updated on the latest research and advancements, hear powerful stories of overcoming obstacles and breaking stereotypes, and become part of the community that values diversity and inclusion in AI.
